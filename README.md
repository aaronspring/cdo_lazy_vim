CDO_lazy_vim README
===================

If you are using vi/vim/gvim for scripting with cdo, you can sometimes hardly remember cdo commands or you are just too lazy to type out sellonlatbox all the time, this might be something for you.

Configuration instructions
--------------------------
For completion: <br>
1. Copy all desired dictionary files but definately including ".vim/dictionary/cdo.dic" to "~/.vim/dictionary" <br>
2. Copy the file ".vim/ftdetect/cdo.vim" to "~/.vim/ftdetect" <br>
3. Add the following line to your .vimrc file "~/.vimrc" <br>
```
set completeopt=longest,menuone
```

Optional completion: <br>
1. If you don't need some dictionaries, eg. those of some other model variables just comment those out in ".vim/ftdetect/cdo.vim" <br>
2. If you want to use <Tab> for auto-completion like in your shell, add those lines to your .vimrc <br>
```
function! Tab_Or_Complete()
  if col('.')>1 && strpart( getline('.'), col('.')-2, 3 ) =~ '^\w'
    return "\<C-N>"
  else
      return "\<Tab>"
  endif
endfunction
:inoremap <Tab> <C-R>=Tab_Or_Complete()<CR>
```
Source: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Smart_mapping_for_tab_completion <br>
The usual <Tab> command will still be executed when no completion is feasable, eg. in the beginning of (empty) lines <br>
3. If you fancy other auto-completion setting, play with the line
```
set complete=longest,menuone
```
The current setting completes up to the last common string and then shows a menu. Other options are listed in the vim help or http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'completeopt' <br>

<br><br>

For syntax highlighting: <br>
1. coming soon <br>
